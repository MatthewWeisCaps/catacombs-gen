Dungeon has both static lights and rooms. Reason for this is because lights can be mapped to rooms. Should never need update method.

point is: entity = all non constant, dynamic things in the world
level/dungeon = all static things which always have and always will exist in the world
	
Components:
	Agent (holds state, body(s))
	StatsSystem
	
MESSAGES SHOULD BE USED ONLY TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN ENTITIES. AND ALL ENTITY COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD BE VIA MESSAGES.


zombies all have a PointLight called "vision," which they can use to poll for enemies.
 - if one zombie spots an enemy, they emit a message to all zombies within a radius.
