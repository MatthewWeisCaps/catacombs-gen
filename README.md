# catacombs-gen
Continuation of catacombs project, but without the experimental design patterns.

# important note
This is an older project which was done for educational / hobby purposes only.
A few specialized aspects of this project, such as the random dungeon generator (but not the dungeon itself) and movement physics,
were adapted for this project from online resources.
