# catacombs-gen

![](docs/catacombs-50fps-looping.gif)

Old project / proof of concept showing *game design patterns*, *steering behaviors*, *simple lighting*, and *random dungeon gen* using libgdx, gdi-ai, Ashley ECS, and Box2d.

This is an older project which was done for educational / hobby purposes only.
A few specialized aspects of this project, such as the random dungeon generator (but not the dungeon itself) and movement physics,
were adapted for this project from online resources (linked where relevant).
